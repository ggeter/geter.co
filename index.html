    <h3>Leveraging Existing Tools to Solve an HR Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      A very large oil and gas company organizes itself into several sub-units for purposes of organziational flexibility. 
      Each sub-unit was managing its own HR staffing and project data in spreadsheets customized for each department. 
      Staffing level reporting at divisional levels was inconsistent, complicating project ramp-ups and staffing planning.
    </p>
    <p>
      We built a centralized HR management toolset with readily available tools the client already had. We standardized data gathering  
      while maintaining flexibility for each department's needs. 
      A centralized dashboard provides live staffing profiles for all departments. 
      These changes result in tighter planning control for the 300+ person division.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Centralizing Management of Engineering Data for OSHA Reporting</h3>
    <p>
      Over the course of decades and changes in leadership, 
      an international gasoline refiner lost control of their safety system design documents. 
      Documentation on systems implementation, tests, and maintenance were not managed in compliance with curent regultions.
      Non-compliance was costing the refiner millions in fines, and the refiner faced a daunting process of managing the rehabilitation of their documentation trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      I led a team of developers to design and deliver a web application that managed the compliance process for 
      thousands of engineering documents. A team of 100+ engineers and operators used the system to 
      complete compliance checklists for each document. The system provided status reports for OSHA review.
      Over the course of two years, the refiner regained control of documentation and celebrated 
      a victory for compliance and safety.
    </p>
    <h3>Crafting a Better Way to Visualize Job Shop Data</h3>    
    <p>
      Project planners for a large subsea wellhead equipment manufacturer juggled
      data between SAP and MS Project to track purchasing information, shop schedule, and vendor delivery performance.
      As shop orders increased, planners became increasingly overworked with data management, keeping them
      off the shop floor where their skills were better suited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using MS Project's VBA interface, I created a master Project file to centralize all purchasing,
      inventory, bill of meterial, and vendor PO data. We eliminated up to two hours per day of time 
      normally spent combing through data, freeing up planners and improving shop on-time performance and quality.
